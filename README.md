**Learn** *Flashcards on Github* 

## How it works 
This project allows you to train your brain using flashcards that are written in Markdown 
and stored for free on Github. All you need to is put a ```cards.md``` in your Master 
branch in the root directory and paste the link to your repo into the Github pages site.


### Writing your own deck 
Learn uses [showdown](http://showdownjs.com/) and [showdown-katex](https://obedm503.github.io/showdown-katex/) for Markdown and Katex support. 
Right now, you can only use single-line expressions i.e. ```$E=mc^2$``` for LaTeX or ```~2+2=5~``` for AsciiMath. 
To create a card, you just need two lines, one for the front and one for the back.
The first line will be the front and the second for the back, make sure you leave no whitespace (linebreaks, extra lines).
